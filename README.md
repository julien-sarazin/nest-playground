# Nest playground

Welcome fellow developer!
This repository is a space dedicated to demonstrate how far a microservice architecture can be implemented with the NestJS framework.

The `master` branch will be stable and use the latest stable versions of the framework.
The `feature/*` branch will contain all experimental tries.

Once the model has been proven to be viable, we will be able to generate a starter template for any kind of microservices.
